    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A traditional Italian meat sauce for pasta</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 cup finely diced onion</li>
      <li>½ cup finely diced celery</li>
      <li>½ cup finely diced carrot</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt</li>
      <li>1 ½ pounds ground beef</li>
      <li>salt</li>
      <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups 2% milk</li>
      <li>2 cups white wine</li>
      <li>1 (28 ounce) can whole Italian plum tomatoes (preferably San Marzano)</li>
      <li>2 cups water, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Melt butter with olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook onion, celery, and carrot with pinch of salt until onion turns translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir ground beef into vegetables and cook, stirring constantly until meat is crumbly and no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Season meat mixture with 1 1/2 teaspoon salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and nutmeg.</li>
      <li>Pour milk into ground beef mixture and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring often, until most of the milk has evaporated and bottom of pan is still slightly saucy, about 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Raise heat to medium high and pour white wine into ground beef mixture; cook and stir until white wine has mostly evaporated, about 5 more minutes.</li>
      <li>Pour tomatoes with juice into a large mixing bowl and crush them with your fingers until they resemble a slightly chunky sauce. Pour tomatoes into sauce; fill can with 2 cups water and add to sauce. Bring to a simmer.</li>
      <li>Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring often, until mixture cooks down into a thick sauce, at least 3 hours but preferably 4 to 6 hours. Skim fat from top of sauce if desired. If sauce is too thick or too hot on the bottom, add a little more water. Taste and adjust seasonings before serving.</li>
    </ol>
